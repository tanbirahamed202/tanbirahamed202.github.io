		   <p style="font-size:26px; font-family:fantasy" align="justify">Hobby is the favourite pastime of a person in his leisure time.It is not his regular bussiness,such as,stamp collection,growing flowers or vegetables,reading  books, or many other similar things.
		   My favourite hobby is reading books.I read all kinds of good books,magazines,newspapers etc.I am to read some books for my examination.I read them with much attention.
		   But when I get leisure or spare time I start reading other books that I like.I feel happy if I get a new book everyday.I read novels,fairy tales,adventure stories,detective novels,poems,essays etc.
		   I do not like to waste time in idle gossiping.I treat the books as my friends as they delight me even at the time of my danger and loneliness.I spend about an hour everyday in reading.I enjoy very much reading any kind of good books.
		   I also acquire knowledge from my reading.It helps me broaden my outlook.so a man must have a hobby that gives immense pleasure,knowlwdge and removes the pangs of loneliness.</p>
